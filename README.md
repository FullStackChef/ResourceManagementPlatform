# Resource Management Platform (RMP)

The Resource Management Platform (RMP) is a robust, modular, and extensible system designed to manage resources efficiently across various domains. Initially developed as a general-purpose resource management solution, RMP provides a foundational framework for building domain-specific applications, including healthcare, education, logistics, and more.

## Vision

RMP aims to be the foundational platform for efficient resource management, capable of scaling from small businesses to large enterprises. While its core is domain-agnostic, it includes the flexibility to create specialized add-ons tailored for specific industries. The first planned add-on will focus on healthcare, creating a Health Resource Management Platform (HRMP).

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend functionality with custom modules.
- **Scalability**: Built to handle growing user bases and data loads.
- **Interoperability**: Designed with interoperability standards to integrate seamlessly with existing systems.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Ensures efficient and up-to-date interactions.
- **Privacy and Security**: Implements best practices for compliance with global data protection regulations.
- **Domain-Specific Add-Ons**: Health-focused features leveraging FHIR resources and anonymized test data from Synthea.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: .NET + Aspire
- **Frontend**: Blazor for real-time, dynamic interfaces
- **Workflow**: Elsa 3 for customizable workflows
- **Messaging**: MassTransit for inter-service communication
- **Data Standards**: FHIR (healthcare add-on)
- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure
- **Test Data Generation**: Synthea for healthcare scenarios
